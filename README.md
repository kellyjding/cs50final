# Overview
Our website works to analyze the user's movie taste using their Letterboxd information. Letterboxd is a website/app where users can log and review movies they've seen. In order to import data from Letterboxd.com to our website, the user will have to log into their Letterboxd account and export a CSV file containing all of their logged films. 

# Homepage
All of these instructions can be found on our site's front page. Since testers may not have a Letterboxd account, we already have two exported CSV files readily available in the ZIP file by the names of ratings.csv (Kelly's exported Letterboxd CSV file) and ratings2.csv (Rave's exported Letterboxd CSV file). Choose any of these two files in the "Choose file" box and click the button to submit. If you do not choose any file, you will be prompted with an "invalid file" message. 

# Loading page
Once you submit a file, you will be brought to a loading page with a fun message beneath the loading logo. (In case you were wondering, Karsten Runquist is a youtuber who makes videos analyzing movies.) After a few seconds, you will be brought to the next page which will analyze your movie taste based on your Letterboxd. 

# Analysis page
Each message on this page is generated based on different categories of movies you have seen. The categories we use to judge the user include genre, production company, runtime, rating, and actors. For instance, if you have seen a movie directed by either Wes Anderson or Quentin Tarantino, you will receive a message about how cool and pretentious you probably think you are. Another example is finding out how many Marvel movies the user has seen, and prompting a message based on this count. At the bottom of this analysis is a button which will take you to a summary page.

# Summary page
This page gives you a summary and gives a list of phrases to describe the user based on their movie taste. At the bottom, there are four social media logos you can click on which will take you to the logo's respective site and allow you to send out a post or message advertising the site. Since we do not currently own a domain, it will advertise a (currently) fake URL to our website.

# ENJOY!
