Our website works to analyze the user's movie taste using their Letterboxd information. Letterboxd is a website/app where users can log and review movies they've seen. In order to import data from Letterboxd.com to our website, the user will have to log into their Letterboxd account and export a CSV file containing all of their logged films. All of these instructions can be found on our site's front page. Since testers may not have a Letterboxd account, we already have two exported CSV files readily available in the ZIP file by the names of ratings.csv (Kelly's exported Letterboxd CSV file) and ratings2.csv (Rave's exported Letterboxd CSV file). Choose any of these two files in the "Choose file" box and click the button to submit. If you do not choose any file, you will be prompted with an "invalid file" message. 

Once you submit a file, you will be brought to a loading page with a fun message beneath the loading logo. (In case you were wondering, Karsten Runquist is a youtuber who makes videos analyzing movies.) After a few seconds, you will be brought to the next page which will analyze your movie taste based on your Letterboxd.
